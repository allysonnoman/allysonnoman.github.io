          Allyson Noman is a first-generation Pakistani-Korean writer, visual artist
          and 
          <a href="https://www.instagram.com/omens_an/" target="_blank"

          Barbara’s College of Creative Studies before moving to New York City,

          >. Channeling that definitive time, she completed her debut novel, FLY
          BY NIGHTS (presently querying for representation). The novel is a
          coming-of-age story set in the booming late aughts restaurant scene of
          New York City. It’s about love, addiction, loss, and ambition.
