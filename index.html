          Allyson Noman is a first-generation Pakistani-Korean writer, artist
          and intuitive celestial reader. She received her BA in Creative
          Writing and Book Arts from UC Santa Barbara's College of Creative
          Studies before moving to New York City, where a decade in hospitality
          led her to Miami Beach as a managing partner of
          <a href="https://employeesonlynyc.com/" target="_blank"
            >Employees Only</a
          >. Channeling that definitive time, she completed her debut novel, FLY
          BY NIGHTS (presently querying for representation). The novel is about
          restaurants, love, addiction and coming-of-age in New York City.
